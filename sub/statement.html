<p style="text-align:center"><a href="">About</a></p>

<h1>The Anti-War Initiative Statement:</h1>
<p>1. I oppose violence that leads to profit in all its different forms: economic subjugation, mass surveillance, wounding, killing, bombing, land grabbing and induced environmental destruction including starvation, unfair resource extraction and first-world propagated climate change. </p>

<p>2. I oppose the collaboration of educational institutions at all levels with industries that propagate violence. I oppose the duplicitous language used by these institutions whereby phrases such as "intellectual values", "a better future", "serving humanity" and "useful applications" are used while such collaborations are on-going.</p>

<p>3. I favor a world where people come before profits and productive and honest discussion should reflect that rather than obscure and allow for profits to come before people.</p>
