<p style="text-align:center">About</p>

<h1>Who We Are:</h1>
Humans. That is what we are. And humans care. They care for other humans over arms and tools of war. In a world where foreign policy is dictated by peace-via-armament, we work to reveal the individuals who profit off this cycle. The flow of "talent" from university campuses to venture capital, private equity, arms manufacturers and mass-surveillance companies, is what feeds the fire. By exposing these war-profiteerers and their industries, we will help humanity be vigilant of the morality of "success" in modern day society. We will not be complicit and neither should you. Join us in the fight against genocide, war and greed.
